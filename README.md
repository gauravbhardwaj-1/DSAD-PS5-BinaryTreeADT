1. Problem Statement
Given the current pandemic, an organization intends to use the unique employee ID and smart card to identify the whereabouts of their employees within the office premises. Whenever the employee swipes his card in the office the employee ID is recorded. When an employee enters into the office for the first time, the counter is set to 1. From then onwards, each time an employee swipes out of the office premises the counter is incremented, and incremented again when he enters back. If the counter is odd, it means the employee is in the office premises and if the counter is even, it means he is out of the premises.
The organization uses this data to perform the following analytics:
1. How many employees came today?
2. Number of employees that have come today and are currently in office?
3. Check specific employee whereabouts?
4. List of employees that have swiped (in or out) more than x number of times?
5. Which employee ids within a range of IDs attended office, the swipe counter for them, and whether they are inside or outside office?

Implement the above problem statement in Python 3.7 using BINARY TREE ADT.
Perform an analysis for the questions above and give the running time in terms of input size: n.

This code implements binary tree and it's functions like binary search in python.
